Container Bridge Instance Installation:

1). Clone this repo into a Linux instance that supports docker images

2). cd into the cloned repo and run: ./run-reload-bridge.sh

Once the container instance is live, you must configure the bridge and bind it between your mbed Connector account and your PubSub Service in Google Cloud

1). In Google Cloud, create your project... your project will be named.  Save this name

2). Create a PubSub instance in your project - enable the PubSub API.

3). In Google Cloud IAM, create a service account and authentication JSON for project. This will be your "IAM credential JSON"

4). Next go to https://connector.mbed.com and create your mbed Connector Account

5). Once your Connector account is created, you need to "Access Keys" to create a Connector API Key/Token. Record the Token Value

Now that you have your:

    - Google Cloud Project Name. Enter this as your "google_cloud_application_name" value

    - Google Cloud Project IAM credential JSON. Enter this as your "google_cloud_auth_json" value

    - Connector API Key/Token generated

Go to:  https://[[your containers public IP address]]:8234

    - username: "admin" (no quotes)

    - password: "admin" (no quotes)

Enter each of application name value, auth json value, and Connector API Token

    - Please press "SAVE" after *each* is entered... 

    - Once entered, press "Restart" to restart the bridge

Your Connector bridge should now be configured and operational. 

Additionally, a Google Cloud PubSub example has been published here:

This sample provide an example on how, from within Google Cloud, you can read and react to events and telemetry via the bridge.
